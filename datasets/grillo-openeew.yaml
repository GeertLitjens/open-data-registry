Name: OpenEEW
Description: |
    Grillo has developed an IoT-based earthquake early-warning system,
    with sensors currently deployed in Mexico, Chile, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica,
    and is now opening its entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer
    data to the world to encourage the development of new algorithms
    capable of rapidly detecting and characterizing earthquakes in
    real time.
